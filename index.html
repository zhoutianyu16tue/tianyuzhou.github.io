            <h2>My Name is Tianyu Zhou, and I am a Machine Learning/Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced C++/Python programmer who currently has a strong focus on applied Machine Learning.
		    In the past two years, I have been focusing on Huawei NPU-accelerated platforms that cover edge inference, data center training.
            <p>
			As a tech-enthusiast, I have been constantly exploring stacks such as Pytorch,
		    <a href="https://www.hiascend.com/software/cann">CANN</a> (closest to CUDA),
		    <a href="https://www.mindspore.cn/en">MindSpore</a> (Huawei NN framework).</p> 
		In my free time, I read research papers and seek opportunities to implement neural nets with MindSpore technology. I am currently taking NLP course provided 
		by Stanford to gain some working knowledge in this blooming field. 
		BMW and Mazda are my two favorite car brands. Working on my Mazda 3 brings me lots of joy.

                <p>Transformer-like neural nets are so hot right. I could not resist the urge to get some hands-on experience with it. I think the best way is to read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf">original paper</a>
                    and start the implemtentation from scratch. That is how the project was born.

                <p>The core of ViT archtecture is MultiheadAttention, which is available in <a href="https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.5/api_python/mindspore.parallel.nn.html?highlight=multiheadattention#mindspore.parallel.nn.MultiHeadAttention">MindSpore</a> (and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MultiheadAttention.html">Pytorch</a> too).
                    It was that not hard to implement it yourself. You are guaranteed to get a much better understanding.

		    This work implements Huawei NPU acceleration to libValkka as a separate module.

            <p>ACL (Ascend Computing Language) provides a collection of C++/Python APIs for developing neural network inference applications on the Huawei NPU platform. These APIs are designed for image preprocessing,
            media data processing, neural network and customized operators execution.</p>

            <p>This repository provides Python programs that includes YOLOv3, YOLOv5, OpenPose etc.
                They are meant not only for demonstration purpose but also help developers to quickly

                <h2>Route Planning with Neural Networks</h2>
                <p>Without a navigation software, how does a human find an efficient path from A to B with little knowledge
                    of the road network?
                    A quick answer is that, a human will gather information from road signs (direction and speed limit). Can we teach a neural network agent to navigate like a human?
                </p>
                <p>In my thesis work, I took a staggered approach by first training a simple NN to be greedy. Then I generated thousands of graphs with NetworkX with random edge attributes (simulating road traffic situation).
                <p>The paths generated from A* and Dijkstra's algorithm are fed to a neural network agent so it can generate similar paths. The trained agent showed some very interesting characteristics.

                <h2>Multimodal Fusion for Human-Robot Collaboration</h2>
                <p>I had the honor to work with Dr. Hongyi Liu as a research assistant during my pursuit of a master degree at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. In this work, an neural net architecture consists of three modalities: speech, hand motion (LeapMotion), and body motion (video) is proposed.</p>

                <p>Three unimodal models were first trained to extract features, which were further fused for representation sharing. Experiments showed that the proposed multimodal-fusion model outperforms the three unimodal models.
